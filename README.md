## Architecture

Builder follows the @akaoio principle of "Class = Directory + Method-per-file":

```
Builder/
  index.ts          # Class container
  constructor.ts    # Initialize configuration
  build.ts          # Main build execution
  watch.ts          # Watch mode
  validate.ts       # Config validation
  clean.ts          # Clean output
```

## Testing

Builder is tested with @akaoio/battle using real PTY emulation for maximum accuracy.

```bash
npm test
```

## Documentation

Documentation is generated with @akaoio/composer from atomic YAML files.

```bash
npm run docs:build
```
